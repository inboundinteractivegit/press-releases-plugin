🚀 PressStack v1.5.4 Released: Free WordPress Press Release Plugin Gets Enterprise Upgrade

Hey WordPress community!

Just pushed a major update to PressStack that I'm excited to share:

**The Big Changes:**
- URL capacity increased from 100 to 1,000 per press release
- Bulk import now handles 1,000 URLs (was 200)
- Fixed several critical bugs affecting press release creation
- Zero breaking changes - existing installations just work better

**Why This Matters:**
This started as reports of "Maximum 200 URLs" errors from users managing large PR campaigns. Instead of a quick patch, we rebuilt the capacity limits from the ground up.

**Technical Details:**
- Enhanced validation in save_press_release_urls()
- Optimized database operations for scale
- Maintained all security features (rate limiting, XSS protection, etc.)
- Full backward compatibility

**Still Free:**
This remains a completely free plugin. We believe powerful press release management shouldn't require expensive subscriptions.

- Changelog: Full technical details included
- Issues/Support: GitHub issues page
